This safe pipeline features a [canary deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/machine-learning-lens/canary-deployment.html) strategy with rollback on error.

A customer-managed encryption key in in Amazon KMS for encrypting data and artifacts.\n", "1. A secret in Amazon Secrets Manager to securely store your GitHub Access Token.\n", "1. Several AWS IAM roles so CloudFormation, SageMaker, and other AWS services can perform actions in your AWS account, following the principle of [least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)\u21d7.\n", "1. A messaging service in Amazon SNS to notify you when CodeDeploy has successfully deployed the API, and to receive alerts for retraining and drift detection (signing up for these notifications is optional).\n", "1. Two Amazon CloudWatch event rules: one which schedules the pipeline to run every month, and one which triggers the pipeline to run when SageMaker Model Monitor detects certain metrics.\n", "1. An Amazon SageMaker Jupyter notebook with this workshop content pre-loaded.\n", "1. An Amazon S3 bucket for storing model artifacts.\n", "1. An AWS CodePipeline instance with several pre-defined stages. \n", "\n", "Take a moment to look at all of these resources now deployed in your account. \n", "\n", "![MLOps pipeline architecture](../docs/mlops-architecture.png)\n", "\n", "In this notebook, you will work through the CodePipeline instance created by the CloudFormation template. It has several stages:\n", "\n", "1. **Source** - The pipeline is already configured with two sources. If you upload a new dataset to a specific location in the S3 data bucket, this will trigger the pipeline to run. The Git source can be GitHub, or CodeCommit if you don\u2019t supply your access token. If you commit new code to your repository, this will trigger the pipeline to run. \n", "1. **Build** - In this stage, CodeBuild configured by the build specification `model/buildspec.yml` will execute `model/run_pipeline.py` to generate AWS CloudFormation templates for creating the AWS Step Function (including AWS Lambda custom resources), and deployment templates used in the following stages based on the data sets and hyperparameters specified for this pipeline run. You will take a closer look at these files later in this notebook. \n", "1. **Train** The Step Functions workflow created in the Build stage is run in this stage. The workflow creates a baseline for the model monitor using a SageMaker processing job, and trains an XGBoost model on the taxi ride dataset using a SageMaker training job.\n", "1. **Deploy Dev** In this stage, a CloudFormation template created in the build stage (from `assets/deploy-model-dev.yml`) deploys a dev endpoint. This will allow you to run tests on the model and decide if the model is of sufficient quality to deploy into production.\n", "1. **Deploy Production** The final stage of the pipeline is the only stage which does not run automatically as soon as the previous stage is complete. It waits for a user to manually approve the model which was previously deployed to dev. As soon as the model is approved, a CloudFormation template (packaged from `assets/deploy-model-prod.yml` to include the Lambda functions saved and uploaded as ZIP files in S3) deploys the production endpoint. It configures autoscaling and enables data capture. It creates a model monitoring schedule and sets CloudWatch alarms for certain metrics. It also sets up an AWS CodeDeploy instance which deploys a set of AWS Lambda functions and an Amazon API Gateway to sit in front of the SageMaker endpoint. This stage can make use of canary deployment to safely switch from an old model to a new model."]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["# Import the latest sagemaker and boto3 SDKs.\n", "import sys\n", "\n", "!{sys.executable} -m pip install --upgrade pip\n", "!{sys.executable} -m pip install -qU awscli boto3 \"sagemaker>=2.1.0<3\" tqdm\n", "!{sys.executable} -m pip install -qU \"stepfunctions==2.0.0\"\n", "!{sys.executable} -m pip show sagemaker stepfunctions"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["Restart your SageMaker kernel then continue with this notebook."]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["# Replace `None` with the project name when creating SageMaker Project\n", "# You can find it from the left panel in Studio\n", "\n", "PROJECT_NAME = None\n", "\n", "assert PROJECT_NAME is not None and isinstance(\n", "    PROJECT_NAME, str\n", "), \"Please specify the project name as string\""]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["import boto3\n", "from IPython.core.display import HTML, display\n", "\n", "\n", "def get_provisioned_product_name(project_name):\n", "    region = boto3.Session().region_name\n", "    sc = boto3.client(\"servicecatalog\")\n", "    products = sc.search_provisioned_products(\n", "        Filters={\n", "            \"SearchQuery\": [\n", "                project_name,\n", "            ]\n", "        }\n", "    )\n", "    pp = products[\"ProvisionedProducts\"]\n", "    if len(pp) != 1:\n", "        print(\"Invalid provisioned product name.
